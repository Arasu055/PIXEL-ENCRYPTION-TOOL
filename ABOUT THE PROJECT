Image Encryption and Decryption Script
This Python script leverages the Pillow (PIL) library to perform simple encryption and decryption on images using a bitwise XOR operation.
By applying a user-defined key, the script alters the RGB values of each pixel in the image, effectively scrambling or unscrambling the visual data.
The script can be used in two modes: encryption to protect the image, and decryption to restore the image to its original state. 
This is a straightforward example of how image data can be manipulated at the pixel level for security purposes.
To use the script, simply provide the path to the image, specify a secret key (as an integer), and choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the image.
The processed image will be saved as a new file with the appropriate suffix (_encrypt or _decrypt) appended to the original file name.
